# Welcome to Middle Earth Folk

Three rings for the Elven Kings, under the sky.<br />
Seven for the Dwarf Lords, in their halls of stone.<br />
Nine for the Mortal Men, doomed to die.<br />
One for the Dark Lord, on his dark throne,<br />
In the Land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.

## [Of Elves](/projects/elves/en/latest
Elves are from the West, and will return to the West at the end of the Third Age.

## [Of Men](/projects/men/en/latest
Men are mortal, and are thus sometimes greedy and suspect.  Approach with caution.
