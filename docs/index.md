# Welcome to Middle Earth Folk

Three rings for the Elven Kings, under the sky.<br />
Seven for the Dwarf Lords, in their halls of stone.

## Of Elves
Elves are from the West, and will return to the West at the end of the Third Age.

## Of Men
Men are mortal, and are thus sometimes greedy and suspect.  Approach with caution.
